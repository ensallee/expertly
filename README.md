# Expertly

Expertly is a full stack skill-sharing Rails app that allows teachers to create online course listings and connect with students. A user can register as a teacher, a student, or both, and then edit his or her profile to reflect the courses he or she is teaching and/or enrolled in. Teachers can either create a course listing in a skill that is already part of the catalog, or they can create a course listing in a new skill and add it to the catalog. Students are able to browse the course catalog by category and easily enroll in courses, and they can also leave anonymous reviews of the teachers from whom they took a course. These reviews will appear on the teacher’s profile.

## Getting Started

To use Expertly, first fork and clone this repo. You will then need to run `bundle install`, as well as `rails db:migrate` and rails `db:seed`. Once you’ve finished these steps, run `rails s`, which will launch the app on a local server. You can either browse the catalog as a guest, or create a guest account to get the full Expertly experience. We recommend registering as both a teacher and a student in order to experience all of Expertly’s functionality.
